<b>Ol Pejeta Conservancy</b> is a 364sq km wildlife conservancy situated between the foothills of <b>Mount Kenya</b> and the <b>Aberdares</b> and its game-to-area ratio tops the Kenyan park and reserve league. Nestled in the foothills of the snow-capped Mount Kenya within Laikipia County in central Kenya, <b>Ol Pejeta Conservancy</b> stands as a pioneering force in the realm of conservation. Renowned for its dedicated efforts, the Ol Pejeta Conservancy gained global recognition for safeguarding the planet’s sole remaining pair of northern white rhinos. In addition, this idyllic location, framed by the majestic presence of Mount Kenya, underscores Ol Pejeta’s commitment to preserving endangered species and fostering biodiversity. The sanctuary’s proactive role in wildlife protection and habitat conservation makes it a symbol of hope and a leading example in the ongoing global endeavor to safeguard endangered species. Ol Pejeta Conservancy is a renowned wildlife haven in Kenya that promises a plethora of attractions. Nestled against the backdrop of breathtaking landscapes, this conservation marvel boasts an impressive array of wildlife, including the iconic Big Five. Planning a <b>Safari to Ol Pejeta Conservancy</b> the home of the last two northern white rhinos on Earth, visitors can also witness the unique interplay of nature and community initiatives, making it a holistic experience. Whether you seek thrilling safaris, conservation insights, or a connection with nature’s wonders, Ol Pejeta Conservancy awaits, offering diverse and enriching attractions. The Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya has over 10000 large mammals and it is the only park where the big 5 and chimpanzees can be seen. It is also where the fastest growing population of rhino in Africa can be found. There are southern white rhino, about 80 endangered black rhino and in a special sanctuary there are two of the world’s last remaining northern white rhino. Safari by vehicle is not the only option at Ol Pejeta, safari game walks, horse rides and even camel rides are available, as are <b>safari night drives</b>. Since being established in 1988 Ol Pejeta has had a colorful list of previous owners including Lord Delamere, an early and influential settler from Britain, shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis’ father Roussel and the arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. It was set up originally as a cattle ranch but herds of migrating elephant regularly destroyed the fenced enclosures making intensive cattle farming impracticable. Cattle still plays a role in Ol Pejeta today but as a managed livestock within the conservancy and is used to maximize the bio-diversity of the land making Ol Pejeta an integrated wildlife and livestock area. The conservancy is keen to educate as well and has an Environmental and Conservation Centre that welcomes around 100 Kenyan schools through its doors annually. The Centre focusses on teaching ecology, culture and the importance of sustainable wildlife management to safeguard the future of the conservancy. Visitors can also learn about local culture and traditions by meeting the peoples of the Samburu, Turkana, Pokot and Maasai.

              <b>June to October</b> are the best months to visit Ol Pejeta. This is the dry season, and generally the further into the dry season you are, the better the game viewing. In November and December there is a short rainy season, but this is a very pretty time to visit as plants are in bloom, and it's a <b>good time to see migratory birds</b>. From January to March there is another dry season, and the <b>flowers will be in bloom</b> following the rains - this time of year makes for great photographs! The long rainy season takes place in <b>April and May. </b> Ol Pejeta Bush Camp is closed in May due to the rains.

         <h2>Ol Pejeta Lion tracking</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Ol Pejeta has fitted a few lions with tracking collars to help rangers <b>establish the prides' location</b>. The lions can wander around the entire 360km² range. To ensure their safety, trackers have been installed to help the rangers <b>keep them safe from poachers. </b>  You can join a ranger to find the lions between 06:30-08:30 and 15:30-17:30. Most visits to Ol Pejeta will include lion tracking and the endangered species enclosure together on the first day - <b>one in the morning, one in the afternoon. </b>

            <h2>Is Ol Pejeta worth visiting?</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Ol Pejeta is one of the best and most organized safari parks in Kenya. They have the Big 5, one of the highest concentrations of rhinos in the world and due to its accessibility and range of activities, it’s a very family-friendly Kenya safari destination too. It’s a great place to add to your itinerary if you are heading up to Northern Kenya to places like Samburu National Reserve and Lake Turkana. The reserve is also close to Mount Kenya, So is Ol Pejeta worth visiting? YES! 
              </p>      
            <h2>Visit Baraka the Blind Black Rhino (FREE)</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              If you visit the Morani Centre (the visitors centre and restaurant) you can go and meet Baraka, a blind black rhino. He lost one eye during a fight and the other to cataracts and is unable to live in the wild, so he lives in the reserve. You can go meet and feed him between 10.30 am and 6.00 pm. He’s super sweet.
               </p>      
            <h2>Ol Pejeta Location </h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              If you’re as passionate about wildlife & conservation then Ol Pejeta Conservancy is the perfect place to visit. Pl Pejeta is a 4-hour drive from Nairobi or half an hour from Nanyuki. Located in Laikipia, a county the size of Wales, has the richest diversity of wildlife in Kenya outside of the Masai Mara. Ol Pejeta Camp and Conservancy is known as one of the best safari areas in the world. The Laikipia highlands conservancies and ranches are home to all the Big 5 including over half of Kenya’s Northern Black Rhino population. Crowned by snow-capped Mount Kenya, bordered by desert, the Rift Valley. Laikipia is a secret kept by Kenya veterans and vastly less touched by tourism than <b>Kenya safari destinations. </b>

    <h2><h2>Visit the chimpanzee sanctuary  </h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Open daily between 10:00 to 15:30, the <b>Sweetwater’s chimpanzee sanctuary</b> has been home to orphaned chimpanzees since 1993 and has provided a natural environment to the non-indigenous species within an island on the park. Chimpanzees that arrive at the sanctuary are nursed to health and released into the conservancy - and Ol Pejeta is the <b>only place in Kenya</b> where you can find these animals.
      </p>
         <h2><h2>Ol Pejeta Rhinos  </h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The northern white rhino (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) is a subspecies of white rhino, which used to range over parts of Uganda, Chad, Sudan, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Years of widespread poaching and civil war in their home range have devastated northern white rhino populations, and they are now considered to be extinct in the wild. Only two remain, both on Ol Pejeta Conservancy. On December 20th, 2009, four of the world’s last remaining seven northern white rhinos arrived at Ol Pejeta. Najin, Fatu, Sudan and Suni had been living in Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic. All previous breeding attempts in the Zoo had been futile, and the hope was that the climate and rich grasslands of Ol Pejeta, a native habitat for the animals, would provide them with more favourable breeding conditions. The black rhino (Diceros bicornis) is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)

    <h2>Ol Pejeta Chimpanzee </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify; font: weight 6px;">
          The Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary was established with an agreement between the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and the Jane Goodall Institute. The aim – to provide lifelong refuge to orphaned and abused chimpanzees from West and Central Africa. Over the last decade, Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary has been compelled to keep accepting chimpanzees rescued from traumatic situations - bringing the total number of chimpanzees in the Sanctuary to 35. Many are confiscated from cramped and unnatural living conditions, and many arrive with horrific injuries sustained from abuse at the hands of humans. Here at Sweetwaters, they get a chance to start over. The chimps have set feeding times, and return to their indoor enclosures at night – but other than that they spend their days exploring, climbing, socialising, and learning to be chimpanzees all over again.

            <p>

You will also encounter many other species including southern white rhinos and a myriad of plains game. Morning and evening rides will conclude with tea and cake at the nearby Morani’s Restaurant.

Nanyuki serves as a gateway to the <b>Laikipia plateau, </b> Kenya most important wildlife conservation areas. Despite <b>Nanyuki</b> being a market town, Nanyuki is the most cosmopolitan city in the area outside of <b>Nairobi, </b> with its share of international tourists (here to <b>climb Mt Kenya</b> or to visit the myriad safari parks), Nanyuki is both the gateway to the exciting region of Laikipia‚ and a popular town in its own right.  This booming town has shed its wide west reputation and is attracting a steady flow of Nairobeans to up-sticks and move.  <b>Nanyuki</b> now has a selection of <b>Nanyuki restaurants‚</b> coffee bars and swimming pools‚ and a range of <b>Nanyuki Hotels‚</b> from Nanyuki conferencing hotels to <b>Nanyuki lodges</b> to luxurious <b>Nanyuki safari camps</b> – most of which have lovely views of nearby Mt Kenya. British Army soldiers (there is a training facility nearby) and Kenyan Air Force pilots (this is the site of the country's main air-force base). <b>Nanyuki airport </b>is located on the western foot hills of <b>Mount Kenya, </b> it lies only 8 kilometers, south of the Equator. <b>Nanyuki</b> is approximately 140 kilometers (87 mi), by air, north of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, the country's largest civilian airport. The <b>Nanyuki airport</b> has a single asphalt runway which measures 1,200 meters (3,900 ft) in length In the 1960s the <b>Nanyuki Airfield</b> was situated along the Nanyuki - Rumuruti Road. It was a grassy runway used by single engine, privately owned aircraft. During the 70s the site was purchased by the Kenya government for the air force, and named Laikipia Air Base. The new civil airfield for Nanyuki was moved to its current location between the towns of Naro Moru and Nanyuki. In the 70s Nanyuki Civil Airfield came into its own when the <b>Mount Kenya Safari Club</b> was attracting the wealthy and famous – and the first <b>Nanyuki charter flights</b> started venturing in. When Tropic Air set up its base here in 1983, there was only a patchy and overgrown tarmac runway and a single caretaker’s hut. Over the years, through investment and development, we have been instrumental in putting Nanyuki Airfield on the map as a major and vital air hub serving Northern Kenya, and linking the north with the rest of Kenya. Today <b>Nanyuki Airport</b> has an excellent reputation for its broad aviation services, along with its charming atmosphere, unique location and Barney’s restaurant! <b>Safarilink</b> operates two daily <b>scheduled flights to Nanyuki</b>‚ Lewa and Samburu.  These <b>Nanyuki flights</b> allow passengers access to all the conservancies in the Laikipia region‚ and to the trio of northern reserves: Samburu‚ Shaba and Buffalo Springs. Tropic Air is a privately owned air charter company, incorporated in the early 1990s at the time that northern Kenya’s low-impact and high value tourism lodges and camps were emerging
